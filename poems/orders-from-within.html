<main>"Orders from Within"
I wake before the sun,
not because it’s noble,
but because silence is a weapon
and I sharpen it alone.
Discipline ain't décor, it’s the scaffolding
I build my sanity on.
No one’s shouting orders here,
but the mission’s still live.
Move with intent.
Watch the terrain,
read the room like it’s booby-trapped
with old habits
and fragile egos.
I don’t just show up, I lead.
By example,
by the weight I carry quietly
when no one’s counting.
Because the real fight?
It ain’t out there, it’s in the choices
I repeat when no one’s watching.
I scan my day like a war map.
Where’s the friction?
Where can I maneuver?
Plans adapt,
people falter,
but I stay mobile,
mind sharp like a bayonet
on borrowed time.
Failure don’t rattle me,
I debrief it.
Turn setbacks into recon.
Every scar is intel,
every silence a signal.
And when the suck comes,
I don’t run.
I lace up, lean in,
and whisper back,
“I’ve trained for this.”
Because the mission never ends, 
it just changes names.
Father. Leader. Friend.
Still me.
Still fighting
to make every step
mean something.
And at night,
when I hang my armor,
I ask myself one thing:
“Did I live today
like someone worth following?”</main>
