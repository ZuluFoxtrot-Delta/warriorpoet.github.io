<main>Self

I know who I am, 
and that matters more than winning some imagined final war.
The demons I carry
were never intruders.
They were forged beside me,
shaped by what I endured,
by what I survived,
by what I had to become just to keep moving.
To put them fully to rest would mean cutting away the parts of me that learned vigilance,
that learned endurance,
that learned restraint under pressure.
That wouldn’t be healing.
That would be amputation.
So this is not conquest.
This is command.
I watch the moment an old pattern steps forward, feel it in my body before my mind starts lying.
I know the difference between fear speaking, habit repeating,
and truth arriving quietly.
Awareness doesn’t silence my demons,
it keeps them from driving.
I keep doing the work not because I’m broken,but because I’m responsible.
Unattended wounds don’t stay quiet;
they look for control.
So I train inward.
I reflect.
I check myself.
I build rituals that hold me steady when stress, pain, or isolation try to pull me backward.
This is not weakness.
This is discipline
turned inward.
Some scars still have a pulse.
Some memories still echo.
Peace, for me, is not silence, 
it’s order.
The past acknowledged, not denied.
Integrated, not indulged.
I know what lives in me, and I still choose
how I show up.
I don’t pretend the darkness is gone.
I refuse to let it decide who I become.
I am not trying to be unmarked.
I am choosing to be conscious,
accountable, and awake.
And this, done daily, imperfectly,
honestly, is how I stay whole.</main>
