She doesn’t know it,
but I watch her every morning when she zips up her backpack.

It’s pink, overstuffed,
half-unzipped from yesterday’s rush.
There’s a crumpled drawing sticking out the side—
a stick figure with a beard and tired eyes.
She told me it was me.
Smiling.

But what gets me isn’t the picture.
It’s the way she shoulders that pack
like it’s light,
like it’s nothing.

Because I know what we pass on to our kids
isn’t just DNA or bedtime stories.
It’s the invisible weight.

The stuff they carry
that they never knew had our name on it.

My daughter doesn’t know
she’s carrying the best version of me.

She doesn’t know
how many nights I sat in silence,
fighting not demons
but the fear that my love might not be enough
to cancel out the wars that shaped me.

I want her backpack to stay light.

I want her to grow up knowing
she doesn’t have to earn love through pain,
or bury her emotions to survive.
I want her to believe
stillness doesn’t mean danger
and that silence can be soft.

So I carry what I can,
and what I can’t,
I name.
So it doesn’t end up in her bag
by mistake.
