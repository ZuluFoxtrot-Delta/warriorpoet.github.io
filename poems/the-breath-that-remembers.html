I sat with the ghosts.

Not to banish them  
but to listen.

Not all hauntings come with screams.  
Some wear your uniform.  
Some sleep in your bed.

I’ve carried brothers  
whose names I whisper  
like mantras between breaths.  
They did not make it back.  
I did.

And that’s the burden.

Not survival.  
The aftermath.

There is a lie the war told me:  
That guilt is proof of love.  
That carrying pain  
is how we honor the fallen.  
That to feel joy  
is betrayal.

But I’ve learned this:  
A heart clenched in grief  
cannot hold legacy.

The dead don’t want our sorrow.  
They want our becoming.

So I sit.  
I breathe.  
In. Out.  
Again.

This is the practice.

The battlefield quiets  
not with suppression  
but with awareness.

I name the memory.  
I bless it.  
And I let it pass,  
like clouds through the sky  
I no longer need to control.

The guilt no longer commands me.  
It visits—  
but it does not own.

I saw myself once  
in a dream  
wearing the same gear,  
but smiling.

Not because I forgot.  
But because I forgave.

Not others.  
Me.

Healing is not forgetting.  
It’s loving yourself  
despite remembering.

You do not erase the war.  
You integrate it.

Like fire and flood—  
both destroy and cleanse.  
Like blade and balm—  
both can protect.

I became both.

I walk now with softer eyes.  
Still vigilant.  
Still scarred.  
But open.

And when sorrow returns  
as it will  
I don’t resist.  
I bow.  
I breathe.  
I say:

“I see you.  
But I am still here.”

That is the vow.  
That is the fight.

I did not die.  
So I will live.

Fully.  
Freely.  
Fiercely.

This breath?  
It remembers.  
And still  
it rises.
