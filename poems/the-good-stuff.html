  <main class="poem">I had been home nearly eleven years
before Kamryn took her first breath
and I still hadn't unpacked.
Not my bags.
Not my war.
Not the silence I'd weaponized to stay functional.
I wasn’t dodging bullets anymore,
but I was dodging sleep,
dodging closeness,
dodging myself.
They said I was home.
But no one ever pointed to where that was.
I knew how to clear buildings.
I didn’t know how to sit still in a quiet room
without pacing it like a fire team stack.
I learned to fold laundry with the same precision I folded trauma.
Crisp edges. Tidy piles.
No mess in sight,
but nothing actually clean either.
I lived a lot of life before her.
Jobs. Mistakes. Lovers I kept at arm’s length
even when I held them close.
I played the part.
Laughed on cue.
Went through all the motions of normal.
But I was still deployed
just to a battlefield no one else could see.
And then she came.
Not like a rescue.
More like a reckoning.
Kamryn didn’t make me whole.
She made me honest.
For the first time in over a decade,
I had something in my arms
that didn’t flinch when I flinched.
That didn’t see the ghosts
and didn’t need to.
She just needed me.
So I started to unpack.
Slowly.
Deliberately.
One buried belief at a time.
That I had to be invulnerable.
That pain made me broken.
That love made me weak.
She taught me what armor couldn’t:
That real strength is the ability to stay
not just in the fight,
but in the room,
in the moment,
in her life.
I had a head start on healing.
But I was still lost until I heard her heartbeat
and realized mine hadn’t stopped—it had just gone underground.</main>
