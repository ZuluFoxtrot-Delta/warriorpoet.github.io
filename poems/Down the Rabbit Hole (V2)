  <main>Down the Rabbit Hole (V2)

Night drops like a ruck
you never asked to carry again
heavy, familiar,
tight on the lungs.

The house is quiet,
but your body isn’t.
Your pulse is on patrol.
Your spine is listening
for a sound that isn’t coming
and still, you’re braced.

The ceiling becomes a sky
you don’t trust.
The dark becomes a map
you’ve bled on before.

You shut your eyes
and the world doesn’t fade
it loads.

Like a hard drive of ghosts
spinning up,
like a radio signal
finding its channel.

And then you’re gone.

Not outward.
Not visibly.

Just… gone inward.
Falling.

Down the rabbit hole
where gravity doesn’t mean physics
it means memory.
It means your mind
yanking the cord
and dragging you back
through the places you survived
but never left.

You feel it in the body first:
that split-second ignition
adrenaline,
jaw clench,
hands tight,
a breath you can’t finish.

The animal part of you wakes up,
the part that learned
how to live by staying ready,
how to love by staying guarded,
how to sleep
with one eye open
even when both are closed.

You can’t tell what time it is.

Because time doesn’t work right
in the hole.

A decade ago feels like now.
A smell becomes a doorway.
A sound becomes a siren.
A thought becomes a trigger you can’t un-pull.

You start counting exits
in a room you’re already safe in.

You start listening
for footsteps
in a house that isn’t hostile.

But your nervous system
doesn’t believe in safe.
It believes in next.

And the hole opens wider.

You see faces you buried.
You hear voices
that never made it home.
You feel your own decisions
crawl out of the dark
and sit beside you
like they still have jurisdiction.

The mind runs the replay
like it’s trying to punish you
into being perfect.

Every “what if” becomes a blade.
Every “I should’ve” becomes a round
you chamber again
and again
and again.

This isn’t sadness.

This is warfare
with no uniform,
no front line,
no ceasefire.

A slow ambush
that waits until you’re alone
to strike.

Sleep comes close
and then flinches away
because closing your eyes
feels like surrender,
and surrender
was never part of the job.

So you stay awake.

Not because you want to
because something in you
still thinks you’re responsible
for keeping the world from falling apart.

You grind your teeth
like you’re chewing through steel.

You hold your breath
like oxygen is a privilege.

You scan the shadows
like they owe you answers.

And the worst part

the worst part
is you know exactly what this is.

You’ve named it.
You’ve studied it.
You’ve fought it.
You’ve won against it
a thousand times.

But it keeps coming back
like a war
that found your address.

Down the rabbit hole,
the silence turns violent.

Not loud
but sharp.

The kind of quiet
where you can hear your own mind
loading magazines
of regret.

And you start wondering
how someone can survive so much
and still feel so damn close
to losing themselves.

But even in that place
even in the pit,
even in the spiral

there’s a flicker.

Not hope like a movie.
Not peace like a slogan.

Just a small, stubborn thing
that refuses to die.

A nerve.
A spark.
A last line of defense.

The part of you
that didn’t quit overseas,
and won’t quit here either.

So you breathe
ugly,
shallow,
through clenched ribs
but you breathe.

You grip the edge
of the night
like it’s a ledge.

You don’t “heal” in one moment.

You endure.

You stay.

You ride it out
until the hole gets bored
of failing to kill you.

Because you’ve been through worse
than your own darkness.

And you’re still here.

Still standing guard
over what matters.

Still alive
when the past
tries to recruit you back into the war.

Down the rabbit hole
you fall…

but you don’t disappear.

You don’t vanish.

You come back up
with dirt under your nails
and your name still intact.</main>
