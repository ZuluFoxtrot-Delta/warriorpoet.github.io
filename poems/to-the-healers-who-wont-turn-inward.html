To the Healers Who Won’t Turn Inward

You learned the language of wounds
by listening to everyone else bleed.
You memorized the weight of grief
that wasn’t yours
because it felt safer to carry
than your own.

You are excellent at tending fires
that didn’t start in your chest.
You show up with water, with patience,
with words polished smooth by practice.
Everyone calls you strong.
No one asks what you’re avoiding.

You call it compassion.
And it is.
But it is also a hiding place.

You learned early
that if you stayed useful,
you stayed needed.
That if you were fixing someone else,
no one would ask
what was broken in you.

So you sit beside pain
like it’s a job you were hired to do,
nodding, steady, composed
while your own ache waits quietly
in a room you refuse to enter
because you’re afraid
it won’t let you leave.

This isn’t a condemnation.
It’s an invitation.

You don’t have to resign from caring
to turn toward yourself.
You don’t have to abandon others
to stop abandoning you.

The same gentleness you offer freely
is not wasted on your own scars.
The same patience you give strangers
will not collapse if you use it inward.

You are allowed to sit down
without an emergency to solve.
You are allowed to be unhelpful
while you learn the shape of your own hurt.

There is nothing selfish
about finally asking
who you become
when no one needs saving.

Lay your tools down for a moment.
The world will survive.
But you might finally meet
the part of you
that’s been waiting
to be held
instead of handled.
