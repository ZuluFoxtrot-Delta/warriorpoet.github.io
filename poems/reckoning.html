Reckoning

It took me twenty years
to say it out loud:

My standards were not high.
They were unsustainable.

Forged for war.
Polished by pressure.
Rewarded when failure meant death.

On paper, I was exceptional.
In life, I became unreachable.

I built a machine
when the world needed a man.
And I was damn good at it.

---

I told myself my childhood was just “hard.”
That grit explained everything.
That survival meant success.

But adaptation leaves casualties.

Not just overseas.
Here.
In the rooms where silence replaced honesty.
Where perfection stood in for presence.
Where performance strangled peace.

---

I said I felt no guilt in uniform.
I said the mission justified the cost.

That was only half true.

I felt pride.
And shame.
Sometimes in the same breath.

So I buried it.
So deep it stopped feeling like hiding
and started feeling like home.

I learned omission like a language.
Withheld not just stories
but myself.

Every love held at arm’s length.
Every truth rationed.
Every fear dressed up as discipline.

What if they saw all of me?
What if I did?

---

She saw it before I did.

Named the fracture.
Tried to love me through it.

And I held onto the code
like it was oxygen
not realizing it was the weight
dragging me under.

I didn’t understand
until the silence she left behind
echoed louder than any argument.

Now every word we share
walks through ruins.

Not betrayal.
Not infidelity.

Blindness.
Neglect.
A refusal to believe my way
might not be the only way.

---

My daughter is six.

Radiant.
Unforged.

And I caught myself asking of her
what I once asked of men under fire.

Precision.
Discipline.
Control.

I told myself it would make her strong.

But she does not need to be forged.
She needs to be free.

Free to feel.
Free to fail.
Free to be messy without fear.

---

I used to say I turned out fine.

But fine is not fulfilled.
Fine is not safe to love.
Fine is not present.

Fine is just functioning.

And I am done functioning.

---

For days my mind has spun
replaying faces, conversations, moments
where “I’m fine” became camouflage.

That phrase kept the world comfortable
while I drowned quietly.

Inside me lives a voice that never softens:

Why did you do that?
Be better.
Suck it up. Drive on.

That is the terrain I’ve lived in.
That is the wiring I am dismantling.

Because if my daughter inherits
never-enough,
fierce independence that isolates,
the belief that needing love is weakness—

then the cycle didn’t break.
It just changed hands.

---

The code served its purpose.

Loyalty.
Duty.
Respect.
Selfless Service.
Honor.
Integrity.
Personal Courage.

Origin: survival.
Function: control.
Consequence: isolation.

I see it now.

And seeing is the beginning of choice.

---

This is not an ending.
This is not surrender.

This is recalibration.

Surviving was noble.
But healing—

healing is revolutionary.

She deserves a father without ghosts in his eyes.
She deserved a partner who could be whole.
And I deserve a life
not hidden behind medals, silence,
or standards that left no room for being human.

I am not laying down my strength.

I am learning how to carry it
without armor.

And this time,
I am coming home—

to myself.
