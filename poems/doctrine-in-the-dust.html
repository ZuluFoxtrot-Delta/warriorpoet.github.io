<main> “Doctrine in the Dust”
I don’t write from comfort.
I write from the stillness after the blast,
the breath between
collapse and carry on.
My words aren’t ink…they’re ash and order.
The doctrine I built
after the manuals stopped working.
I never needed a perfect plan,
just the will to get up bleeding
and still move forward.
That’s the difference.
Some men wait for clarity.
I move through the fog
like it owes me something.
The quiet has rank.
It gives orders too.
So I keep the rhythm:
wake before weakness,
scan the field of my own thoughts,
lock down doubt like it’s a threat
wearing my father’s face
or my own reflection.
I’ve learned the war doesn’t end
when the shooting stops.
It just changes its name
and hides in the details.
In missed calls.
Unspoken truths.
The silence that grows teeth.
But I have my rules:
     Show up.
  Hold standard 
  Speak only when it counts.
Leave something worth finding.
And when I go,
when the last entry’s written,
and my armor’s hung for good,
let her find these pages
and know I was never trying to be a hero.
I was trying to be whole.
And that’s harder.
