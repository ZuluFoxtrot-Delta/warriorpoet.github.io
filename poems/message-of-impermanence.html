<h1>Message Of Impermanence</h1>
<main class="poem">
Nothing stays.
Not the pain.
Not the joy.
Not the shape of the clouds overhead.

Even mountains crumble in time.
Even scars fade to memory.

This is not to dismiss your suffering—
it's to anchor you in truth:
You are not your worst day.
You are not the war still echoing in your chest.
You are the breath you just took.
The one after that.
The one you'll take when you finish reading this.

Everything ends.
Especially the parts you think never will.
That includes the hurt.
That includes the numb.

Message received?
Good.
Now stand up.
