<h1>In The Silence Of The Night</h1>
<main class="poem">
In the silence of the night,
I hear the war whisper.
Not loud like it was—
but soft, like it misses me.

My daughter breathes steady in the next room.
She doesn't know the names I still carry.
Doesn't know why I flinch
when the dog barks too sharp.

In the silence of the night,
I sort through the pieces.
I rebuild without instructions.
I hold each broken part to the light
and decide if it still belongs.

The silence is not empty.
It’s a negotiation.
A battlefield of thoughts
where I refuse to surrender
what's left of me
to what tried to take all of me.

In the silence of the night,
I find the edges of peace.
I trace them,
slowly,
until morning.
