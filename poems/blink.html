  <div class="poem">Blink….
Sometimes it feels like that is all I can do. 
At times, I’ve lost control, drowning it out. 
…Blink…
The light from my window falls sweetly on my pillow. 
    Hard to move on when nothing is wrong. 
    I glance over next to me, memories asleep and content, dreaming of where we’ve been.
…Blink…
Tonight, I lie here alone. The bed stretches wide, an ocean of emptiness. 
The ghosts of memories curl around me, whispering secrets of battles fought and lost. 
Past flames that were unconditionally eternal, extinguished now and taking the warmth from all around. 
Their breath, a chill against my skin, like the night wind through forgotten trenches.
… Blink…
The moon peers in, casting shadows on the wall. I trace their edges, wondering if they hold answers. 
Perhaps sleep, although overrated, is a fragile bridge, and I am the tightrope walker, balancing between dreams and the abyss.
…Blink…
In this quiet darkness, I listen. 
The silence echoes with the atmospheric weight of absence, the ache of missing loves and broken hearts. 
    The cries of the fallen. 
…Blink…
Amongst all this, I wonder if sleep will ever find me again, or if I am destined to blink, blink, blink, forever on the edge of surrender.
May the morning light bring solace, or at least the illusion of it. 
For now, I close my eyes, and in that fleeting moment, I am not alone, just suspended, like a fragile thread, between yesterday and tomorrow. 

…Blink</div>
