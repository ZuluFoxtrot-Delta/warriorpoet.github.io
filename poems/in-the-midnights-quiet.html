<h1>In The Midnight’s Quiet</h1>
<main class="poem">
In the quiet of midnight, shadows stretch long,
Whispers of battles past echo in my song.
Echoes of courage mix with whispers of fear,
Yet in this silence, my strength remains clear.

Through the turmoil and night, I stand tall,
A warrior's heart, defiant, heeds the call.
In each breath, resilience softly takes flight,
Braving the darkness, I ignite the light.

Each memory haunts, each nightmare I chase,
But I find my peace in this still, sacred space.
My pen, a weapon, my words, a shield,
In the face of the terror, I refuse to yield.

I write my battles, I scribble my pain,
Turning my struggles into verses, like rain.
Each stanza a step, each rhyme a retreat,
A path through the shadows, guiding my feet.

Though the night is long and shadows are deep,
I hold onto hope, the strength I must keep.
For in these lines and in my mind's eye,
I find a reason to never say die.
The Breach
