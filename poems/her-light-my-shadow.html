Some nights,
I tuck her in and wonder
how much of my quiet
she already understands.

She laughs loud,
loves big,
and doesn’t flinch
at small things.
And I pray she never learns
why that matters.

I walk through this life
with ghosts at my six
and promises in my chest,
but she only sees my hands—
steady, gentle,
made for building, not breaking.

She asks if I’m okay.
I say yes.
And most days,
it's close to true.

Because I choose to feel it all,
to break the cycle,
to let the fire stop with me.

I wear the scars,
so she doesn’t have to.
