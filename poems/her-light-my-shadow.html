Some nights,
I tuck her in and wonder
how much of my quiet
she already understands.

Not with words
but the way children know things
before they have language for them.
The way she watches my eyes
when I think she’s asleep.
The way she holds my hand
a second longer than normal
like she’s anchoring me
to the room.

She laughs loud.
Loves big.
Moves through the world
like it hasn’t tried to break her yet.

And she doesn’t flinch
at small things.

A slammed door.
A raised voice from another room.
A storm on the windows.
A stranger’s tone.
A sudden sound.

She doesn’t twitch.
Doesn’t brace.
Doesn’t scan.
Doesn’t calculate the nearest exit.

And I pray she never learns
why that matters.

I pray she never understands
what it means to live
with your nervous system
wired like a tripwire.
To hear fireworks
and feel your heart
punch through your ribs.
To walk through a grocery store
and still check corners.

I pray she never learns
how the body remembers war
even when the mind says
it’s over.

Because I walk through this life
with ghosts at my six
and promises in my chest.

Ghosts that don’t rattle chains
they wear familiar faces.
They sound like certain voices.
They show up in smells,
in dreams,
in silence.

They show up when it’s dark,
when the world finally stops moving,
when there’s nowhere left to run
except inward.

And the promises…
they weigh more than the ghosts.

Promises I made
in moments no one saw.
Promises I made
to men who didn’t come home.
Promises I made
to myself
when I was barely holding on.
Promises I made
the day I became her father
when I realized
my strength wasn’t mine anymore.

But she doesn’t see the war.

She doesn’t see the rooms
I still revisit at night.
She doesn’t hear
the battles I still fight
when I’m sitting perfectly still.

She only sees my hands
steady, gentle,
made for building, not breaking.

Hands that tie her shoes.
Hands that make her food.
Hands that fix what’s leaking,
tighten what’s loose,
hold what’s heavy.

Hands that carry groceries,
carry backpacks,
carry the weight of being the safe place.

Hands that have done things
the world will never know about
and I’d rather die
than let her have to carry
even one ounce of that.

She asks if I’m okay.

Not like an adult asks.
Not with suspicion
or strategy.

She asks like a child
who loves you so purely
it scares you.

Like she’s checking
if her hero is bleeding
behind the armor.

I say yes.

And most days…
it’s close to true.

Because the truth is,
I don’t get “okay” by accident.
I earn it.

I earn it every time
I choose patience
when my body wants to react.
Every time
I choose softness
when my past wants hardness.
Every time
I take a breath
instead of letting the old instincts
take the wheel.

I earn it
by doing the work
no one claps for.

By sitting with the weight.
By feeling what I avoided for years.
By naming the things
that used to own me.
By looking at the darkness
without letting it make decisions for me.

Because I choose to feel it all.

Not because it feels good
because it’s the only way out.

I choose to let grief exist
without turning it into anger.
To let anger exist
without turning it into damage.
To let fear exist
without turning it into control.

I choose to break the cycle.

The one I was raised in.
The one I learned overseas.
The one that says:
“If you feel, you’re weak.”
“If you soften, you die.”
“If you love, you lose.”

I choose to unlearn that
because I refuse
to pass it down.

And it isn’t easy.

Some nights I’m exhausted
in a way sleep won’t touch.
Some nights I’m standing at her doorway
watching her breathe
and my chest tightens
because I realize how much I have to lose.

Not the kind of lose
that happens in war
the kind of lose
that happens in life.

The kind where love
is the target.

So I let the fire stop with me.

I let it burn in my hands
instead of spreading into hers.
I let it scorch my pride
so she never has to fear my temper.
I let it break me open
so she never learns
that men are made of closed doors.

I wear the scars
so she doesn’t have to.

Not just the scars you see
the ones you can point to
and call a story.

But the quiet scars.
The invisible ones.
The ones that rewrite a man
from the inside out.

I carry those scars
like a shield.

Because she deserves a childhood
that isn’t interrupted
by my past.

She deserves to grow up
thinking the world is safe
until she’s ready to learn otherwise.

She deserves laughter
without flinching.
Love without fear.
Sleep without patrol.

And if my shadow
has to follow me forever
fine.

Let it.

As long as she stays light.

As long as she stays soft.
As long as she stays free.

Because if I do my job right…

The war ends with me.
