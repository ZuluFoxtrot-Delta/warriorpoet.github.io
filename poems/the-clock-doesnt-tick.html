<h1>The Clock Doesn’t Tick</h1>
<main class="poem">
The clock doesn’t tick in here.
Time drips instead—slow, thick, indifferent.
Morning doesn’t break—it limps in,
Dragging yesterday's boots behind it.

I stare at the ceiling like it might offer a map
out of my own head.
No such luck.
Only static up there.
Only silence.

They tell me I survived.
But they weren’t there at 2:47 a.m.
when I fought phantoms no one else could see
and lost again.

I don’t need a medal.
I need sleep.
I need the smell of cordite to leave my nose.
I need one goddamn night where my daughter's voice
isn't drowned out by the screams I keep locked in my ribs.

The clock doesn’t tick.
It just drips,
until I drown
in the space between now and never.
