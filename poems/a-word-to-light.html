<h1>A Word to Light</h1>
<main class="poem">
Speak a word and I will hold it,
Turn it over in calloused hands,
Taste the grit between each vowel
like dust clinging to boots
from a war I haven’t quite left.

I don’t need sermons or speeches—
Just a single syllable with weight.
Something dense enough to remind me
this fight isn’t over
but I’m still in it.

Not for glory.
Not for vengeance.
For the quiet contract made
between fathers and their children—
To show up.
To not disappear when it gets hard.
To bleed if needed,
but never to vanish.

Give me a word and I will sharpen it
until it becomes a blade I can wield
against the dark between my ribs.
The kind that creeps in
after everyone’s gone to sleep.

I will etch that word into memory,
hold it in the small moments—
when she smiles,
when I flinch,
when I almost don’t pick up the phone
but do anyway.

A word can anchor.
Can echo across valleys
of self-doubt and silence.
It doesn’t have to be profound.
Just true.

So speak it,
whatever it is.
I’m listening.
I’ve always been listening.
And I’m ready to turn your word
into light.
