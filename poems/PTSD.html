  <div class="poem">playing with my head.

My mind.
My heart.
My soul.

Like it’s bored.
Like it’s got time to kill
and I’m the only target left.

So I put on normal.
I wear it like a uniform.
Smile when it’s required.
Nod at the right moments.
Laugh on cue.
Show up.
Produce.
Function.

Pretending to be normal.
Pretending not to care.
Pretending I don’t feel my body
tighten up at nothing.
Pretending the silence
doesn’t sound like a warning.

Lying to myself
“It’s just a dream.”
“It’s just a memory.”
“Just a life.”

Like I can label it small
and it will shrink.
Like I can call it “past”
and my nervous system will believe me.

But it doesn’t.

It toys with me.
It drags the old footage
out of storage
and plays it on the inside of my skull
like a punishment.

Making me see things that aren’t there
but they feel real.
Making me hear sounds
that don’t exist anymore
but my body reacts like they do.

Nothing false.
Nothing real.
Just a blurred line
between what happened
and what’s happening now.

Because PTSD doesn’t show you the past
like a story.

It drops you back into it
like a trapdoor.

Everything I’ve already seen.
Already heard.
Already lived.

A replay in my head.
Never ending.
Never ceasing.
No mercy.
No credits rolling.
No off switch.

And the worst part?

I can be standing in my kitchen,
in my own home,
in my own country,
and still feel like I’m not safe.

I can be surrounded by peace
and my body will still search for war.
Still scan corners.
Still listen for impact.
Still brace for a hit that isn’t coming.

My chest tightens
like something is about to happen.
My jaw locks
like I’m getting ready to absorb it.
My hands remember violence
even when I’m only holding a coffee cup.

I tell myself I’m fine.

But fine is just what I say
so nobody asks questions
I don’t know how to answer.

Fine is the lie I learned
to keep the world comfortable
while I’m drowning in my own bloodless battles.

PTSD doesn’t just haunt me
it recruits me.

It makes me relive.
Rehearse.
Recalculate.
Re-run missions
that will never be completed.

And sleep…

Sleep used to be rest.
Now it’s an ambush.

Sleep is a tormentor now
a doorway I hesitate to walk through
because I know what’s waiting on the other side.

The nightmares don’t come gently.
They kick in the door.
They grab me by the throat.
They don’t ask permission.
They don’t explain themselves.

They just drag me under.
Trapping me in my nightmares
where time doesn’t obey rules
and danger is always close enough
to taste.

I wake up exhausted
from fighting wars
that don’t leave bruises
but still leave damage.

I wake up with my heart sprinting
like it ran from something
my eyes never saw.

I wake up angry
at a body that won’t stand down.
At a mind that won’t stop scanning.
At a soul that can’t find quiet
even in a room full of safety.

And then I do it again.

I get up.
I shower.
I put on the face.
I go to work.
I answer questions.
I make decisions.

And nobody sees
the part of me
that spent the entire night
trying not to die
inside my own head.

That’s what PTSD is.

Not weakness.
Not drama.
Not a story.

It’s a war that followed me home
and learned my name.

It’s living in a body
that refuses to believe
the danger is over.

It’s surviving something once
and then surviving it again
every night
in pieces.

And still somehow

I keep going.

Not because it’s easy.
Not because I’m okay.

Because I’m still here.
And being here
is the hardest mission
I’ve ever had to complete.</div>
