<main>Flashbang

Sleep doesn’t fade.
It detonates.

One second I’m nowhere
the next, I’m hit.
A white blast behind my eyes,
instant, total, violent,
like a flashbang going off inside my spine.

No warning.
No ramp-up.
Just pain at full volume.

My body seizes mid-dream,
locked in a position I didn’t choose,
every nerve screaming contact, contact
with no enemy to return fire on.

I try to move.
The thought alone ignites it.
Fire races down my back,
hooks into my hips,
crushes my breath
before it ever becomes a scream.

But I scream anyway.

It rips out of me
raw, animal, uncontrolled.
A sound I don’t recognize
until I realize
it’s mine.

I cry for help
not with dignity
but with panic.
With terror.
With the kind of fear
that only comes when your own body
has you pinned.

I call out.
Again.
Louder.

My throat burns.
My chest convulses.
Tears flood my face
without permission.

I beg
not for relief,
not for answers
just for someone
to break the silence.

But the room doesn’t answer.

The walls don’t move.
The night doesn’t care.
And no matter how hard I scream,
how loud I tear my voice apart,
the only thing that comes back to me
is my own echo
distorted, useless, mocking.

Pain keeps time perfectly.
Each second hits on schedule.
No mercy.
No fatigue.

I am awake in the worst way
fully conscious,
fully trapped,
fully alone
inside a body that has turned hostile.

This isn’t a bad night.
This is an ambush.

Eventually the wave breaks
not because I win,
but because pain decides
it has made its point.

I lie there shaking,
soaked in sweat and tears,
afraid to move,
afraid to breathe too deep,
afraid that if I shift even an inch
it will all come back.

Morning will ask me to function.
To stand.
To perform.
To explain.

But the night knows the truth.

It knows I screamed
until there was nothing left.

And the only one who heard me
was me.</main>
