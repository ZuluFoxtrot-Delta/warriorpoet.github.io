<main class="poem">
Peace is not mere absence; it is the presence of something profound.
It is the tranquil lake reflecting the sky, undisturbed by ripples.
It is the gentle breeze that whispers through ancient trees, carrying secrets of serenity.
Peace is the refuge we seek when the world’s storms rage around us.

But can one truly claim peace without acknowledging its counterpart?
Is it enough to be harmless, like a lamb grazing in a meadow, unaware of the wolf’s shadow?
Perhaps not.

Violence, too, has its facets.
It is not solely the brute force that shatters bones or tears apart cities.
Violence can be subtle, a word laced with venom, a glance that wounds deeper than any blade.
It resides within us, dormant yet potent, waiting for the right spark.

To be capable of violence is to recognize our humanity.
Violence is the shadow cast by our potential.
To be peaceful is not to deny it—but to wield it consciously.

True peace is not passivity.
It is restraint earned through understanding.
