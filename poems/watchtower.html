<main>Watchtower

I was built in pieces.
Some forged in heat,
some wired in silence,
some learned the hard way
when nobody was watching.

I learned early how to stand guard
over doors, over men, over moments
that could end a life or split one in two.
I learned how to count breaths,
how to listen for the sound
that doesn’t belong.

Later, I learned how to build systems
so nothing critical gets forgotten
checklists, routines, backups, failsafes.
Not because I love control,
but because chaos charges interest
and I’ve paid enough.

There are ghosts here.
They don’t scream.
They hum
like machinery left running after midnight,
like a radio tuned between stations.
I don’t chase them anymore.
I log them.
I acknowledge their presence
and keep moving.

Pain taught me humility.
Not the poetic kind
the kind where tying your shoes
becomes a negotiation,
and asking for help
feels like surrender
until you realize
it’s not.

Love taught me risk.
Not the reckless kind 
the kind where you stay soft
even when you know
how hard the world can hit.
Where you don’t armor your heart,
you reinforce it.

Fatherhood changed the mission.
Suddenly every decision
had a longer shadow.
I wasn’t surviving anymore
I was modeling.
Showing her how a man stands
when he can’t run,
how he tells the truth
even when it costs him comfort.

I write to leave markers.
Not for fame.
For continuity.
So if one day she wonders
who her father was
when the lights were off
and the noise was gone,
there’s a record.

This work is not loud.
It doesn’t need to be.
It’s maintenance.
It’s vigilance.
It’s choosing discipline over despair,
presence over numbness,
creation over collapse.

I am not healed.
I am operational.
Still learning.
Still refining.
Still standing watch

not against the world,
but for what matters.

And when the day comes
that I finally power down,
let it be said:

He built something that lasted.
He stayed.
He loved.
He endured.</main>
