  <main class="poem">If I were to die tomorrow,
Tell her I didn’t leave because of her.
Tell her that the war caught up, even when I outran it for years.
Tell her I wanted to stay.
That every breath I ever fought for after combat,
I fought to stay near her.
Tell her that my silence was never a lack of love,
But the only armor I had left.
Tell her I was trying—every goddamn day—to be a man worthy of her trust.
Tell her to write. To scream. To cry. To create.
That nothing she feels is wrong.
And that healing is not betrayal.
Tell her I saw the stars in her eyes, and that was enough light to last a thousand dark nights.
Tell her I didn’t give up.
I just got tired.
Tell her she saved me, again and again,
Even when I couldn’t say it.
Tell her she was never a burden,
She was my reason.
Tell her to forgive me,
And to never forget me.
But more than that—
Tell her to live.
Tell her to keep going.
Tell her I’m proud.
Always.</main>
