<h1>What Shows</h1>

<div class="poem">
Character is to the soul
what appearance is to the body
the first signal,
the silent introduction,
the truth that lingers
after the handshake fades.

A face can be polished.
A posture can be practiced.
A smile can be borrowed
for the right room.

But character
that can’t be faked for long.

It’s the weight behind the words.
The spine inside the promise.
The unseen code
that holds a man upright
when no one is watching.

Genuineness doesn’t announce itself.
Refinement doesn’t need applause.
A real man doesn’t proclaim
what he is
he lives it
until it becomes undeniable.

It shows indirectly
like heat from a flame
you never touched.

In how he treats the waiter.
In how he speaks to the weak.
In how he carries stress
without spilling it
onto everyone around him.

In how he handles anger
without turning it into violence.
In how he walks through loss
without becoming cruel.

True integrity is quiet.
It doesn’t posture.
It doesn’t perform.
It doesn’t beg to be believed.

It simply holds.

Because appearance is a surface.
Character is a root.
And roots don’t shine
they build.
They anchor.
They keep the whole damn tree standing
through storms nobody sees.

Outward beauty is instant
judged in seconds.

But character takes time.
It reveals itself slowly,
like a shoreline
after the tide keeps returning
again, and again,
until the shape of you
is undeniable.

And when the world forgets your face,
it will remember this:

How you moved through life.
How you made people feel.
How consistently you chose
honor over ego,
truth over comfort,
strength over noise.

That’s the real appearance.
Not what they saw at first
but what remained
after everything else
wore off.
