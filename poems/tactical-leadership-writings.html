<h1>Tactical Leadership Writings</h1>
<main class="poem">
Leadership is a privilege earned in blood,
not a title pinned by policy.
I led because I bled.
Because others bled for me.

You don't teach this in a classroom.
You learn it when your decisions carve futures.
When one bad call means a folded flag.

Tactical leadership is not about barking orders—
it's about silence.
The kind before breaching.
The kind that speaks louder than words.

I led from the front,
not for glory,
but so I’d be the first to absorb the consequence.
If the mission went south,
I wanted them to step over me,
not retreat behind me.

I lead still.
Now with words instead of rifles,
but the weight is the same.
I write for the ones still in it—
the ones counting exits
in restaurants
because old habits never retired.

Tactical leadership never ends.
It just changes battlefield.
