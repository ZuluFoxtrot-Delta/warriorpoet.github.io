  <main>The Screams

They don’t sound like memory.
They sound like now.

They come when the house is quiet
and my body mistakes silence for danger.

Sleep feels like a breach.
Every time I cross the threshold
something yanks me back
not yet, not safe, stay sharp.

I wake up exhausted from guarding nothing.
From fighting wars that no longer have coordinates.

The screams don’t ask permission.
They don’t explain themselves.
They just arrive
and leave me staring at the ceiling
wondering how a man can be this tired
and still unable to rest.

Morning comes with no momentum.
Just weight.
Just the quiet shame of needing more time than the world is willing to give.
And yet I rise anyway,
moving through the rooms like a man
trying not to wake a sleeping beast
that lives only in his nerves.

I make breakfast with hands
that remember battles my mind can’t name.
I button a shirt over a chest
that still feels the concussion of impact.

People say it’s over now,
as if time were a solvent
strong enough to dissolve vigilance.
As if the body didn’t keep its own calendar.

But some days,
in the small mercy between breaths,
I feel the faintest shift
a loosening, a letting go,
a moment where the air doesn’t taste like warning.

And I hold onto that.
Not as a promise,
but as proof
that even a haunted system
can learn a different rhythm.

That one day
quiet might mean quiet again.</main>
