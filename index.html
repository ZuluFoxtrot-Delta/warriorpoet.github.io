      <h2>The Weight</h2>
      <p>
        You think we leave it there<br><br>
        in the desert,<br>
        in the jungle,<br>
        in the blood-soaked corners of the world<br>
        where the mission used to scream<br>
        clear.<br><br>

        But no.<br>
        It comes home.<br><br>

        Folded in duffel bags.<br>
        Tucked in the creases of silence.<br>
        Embedded in muscle memory<br>
        like shrapnel you never dig out<br>
        because it’s fused with the bone.<br><br>

        They call it PTSD<br>
        like it’s an echo.<br>
        But echoes fade.<br>
        This is a goddamn symphony<br>
        of triggers,<br>
        of sleep you can’t keep,<br>
        of breath that won’t stay steady<br>
        in a grocery store line.<br><br>

        I carry missions<br>
        I never debriefed.<br>
        Friends I never buried.<br>
        Orders I followed<br>
        but never forgave myself for.<br>
        Moments where I made it back,<br>
        but not whole.<br><br>

        And nights?<br><br>
        Nights are where the war<br>
        wants round two.<br><br>

        The bed’s a kill zone.<br>
        Sleep’s an ambush.<br>
        Even silence has weight<br>
        because it dares you to listen<br>
        to what you’ve buried<br>
        under bravado and caffeine.<br><br>

        I’ve trained to carry men on my back,<br>
        but no one trained me<br>
        for the weight of remembering.<br><br>

        No one taught me<br>
        how to explain to my daughter<br>
        why Dad flinches<br>
        when nothing’s there,<br>
        or why he’s pacing at 0300<br>
        with eyes that haven’t blinked<br>
        in hours.<br><br>

        The weight isn’t just memory.<br>
        It’s restraint.<br>
        Holding back the scream.<br>
        The fury.<br>
        The tears.<br><br>

        It’s deciding,<br>
        again and again,<br>
        to stay.<br>
        To live.<br>
        To fight for peace<br>
        with tools<br>
        sharpened in war.<br><br>

        This is what I carry:<br>
        Not just ghosts.<br>
        But the choice<br>
        to keep walking with them<br>
        and still<br>
        protect<br>
        the living.

      <h2>In the Quiet of the Night, My Mind's a Warfront</h2>
      <p>
        In the quiet of the night, when shadows whisper lullabies,<br>
        And the world is wrapped in a gentle cloak of quiet sighs,<br>
        I lay, a soldier, on a bed that feels like foreign ground,<br>
        Where every breath is drawn through the barrel of a pounding sound.<br><br>

        My eyes, they close but never shut the scenes that play,<br>
        Reels of war, a silent film in stark, unyielding gray,<br>
        Each heartbeat marks a step through fields of yesteryear,<br>
        Where fear and valor danced without a single tear.<br><br>

        The night is my battlefield, a stage of haunting cheer,<br>
        Where ghosts of the fallen whisper in a brother's ear,<br>
        Their faces, once so vivid, now faded and obscured,<br>
        Call out from the fog of a war that's never occurred.<br><br>

        In daylight, I don the mask of the man you see,<br>
        But nightfall peels it back to reveal what's truly me,<br>
        The screams of the fallen echo in my soul,<br>
        A cacophony of anguish that takes its toll.<br><br>

        The smell of gunpowder clings to my every thought,<br>
        And the taste of metal is what fear has bought,<br>
        The touch of a hand becomes the jolt of a grenade's fright,<br>
        And in the quiet, the quiet, the night becomes the fight.<br><br>

        I walk the tightrope of sanity's thin, worn line,<br>
        Where every step is a battle, a fight to be fine,<br>
        My mind's a minefield where memories lay in wait,<br>
        To trip the wires of peace and shatter my fate.<br><br>

        The sun's sweet kiss is but a fleeting reprieve,<br>
        For when darkness falls, the war in me does not leave,<br>
        I fight the demons that dwell within my skull,<br>
        Their shadows cast long, a never-ending brawl.<br><br>

        The world outside is bright and filled with cheer,<br>
        Yet I'm adrift in a sea of doubt and fear,<br>
        The laughter of children, a symphony so dear,<br>
        In my heart, a minefield, a battle I hold near.<br><br>

        Thunderstorms become the drumming of a war's crescendo,<br>
        Each flash of lightning a flare, a stark reminder of the commando,<br>
        The rain, a deluge of tears for all the friends I've lost,<br>
        The thunder's roar, a chorus of the endless cost.<br><br>

        My hands, once steady, now shake with unseen fright,<br>
        As the whispers of the dead keep me from the light,<br>
        My heart, a cage of pain and grief's tight plight,<br>
        Struggles to beat in time with the world's delight.<br><br>

        In the quiet of the night, I am not alone,<br>
        For the specters of war have made this place their home,<br>
        They dance and taunt with every moonbeam thrown,<br>
        Reminding me of the price for which I've grown.<br><br>

        I crave the silence that others take for granted,<br>
        But in its stead, I'm haunted and enchanted,<br>
        By the echoes of battles that never really ended,<br>
        By the screams of the fallen, my soul has been rended.<br><br>

        Sleep is but a memory, a fleeting embrace,<br>
        As the night is ruled by the warrior's disgrace,<br>
        My mind's a warfront, a prison without a base,<br>
        Where peace is but a whisper, a distant place.<br><br>

        I march to the rhythm of the past's cruel jest,<br>
        Where every moment is a battle, a quest,<br>
        To find a place where the bombs don't jest,<br>
        Where my heart can finally find some rest.<br><br>

        In the quiet of the night, my thoughts are stark,<br>
        Of the things I've seen, the souls that left their mark,<br>
        But amidst the chaos, a star's faint spark,<br>
        Gleams through the gloom, a promise, not just stark.<br><br>

        For every dawn that breaks the night's dark seal,<br>
        Is a victory, a moment to feel real,<br>
        A chance to heal the wounds that never heal,<br>
        To live the life that's not just about the deal.<br><br>

        So, I fight on, in the quiet of the night,<br>
        With the strength of those who held on tight,<br>
        For in the end, it's not just a fight,<br>
        But the will to live beyond the battle's plight.
