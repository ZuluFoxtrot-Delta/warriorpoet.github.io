      <h2>No Medal for This</h2>
      <p>No one pins you for choosing not to rage.<br>
      No parade for walking past the bottle.<br>
      No ribbons for watching your tone<br>
      when your chest feels like a minefield.<br><br>
      But this?<br>
      This is where the war is real.<br><br>
      Where I sit with pain like it’s intel,<br>
      not enemy. Where I let my daughter cry<br>
      and don’t flinch—because I finally know<br>
      tears aren’t weakness, they’re clearance for truth.<br><br>
      No one sees it, but that’s okay.<br>
      I don’t do it for them.<br>
      I do it so she never wonders<br>
      if her father chose silence over healing.<br><br>
      Because the hardest thing I ever learned<br>
      was how to stay after surviving.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="poem">
      <h2>The Things She’ll Never Know</h2>
      <p>She’ll never know<br>
      how many times I stood outside her door,<br>
      hand raised to knock—<br>
      not because she needed me,<br>
      but because I needed her laughter<br>
      to pull me back<br>
      from whatever dark I’d wandered into.<br><br>
      She’ll never know<br>
      the number of times I rehearsed<br>
      “I’m proud of you”<br>
      like a mission brief,<br>
      because love always felt easier to show than to say.<br><br>
      She’ll never know<br>
      that every night terror I fought alone<br>
      was followed by a whisper:<br>
      “You still have to wake up for her.”</p>
    </div>
    <div class="poem">
      <h2>The Weight</h2>
      <p>It’s not just the ruck I carried<br>
      or the rounds I fired.<br><br>
      It’s the names I never say aloud,<br>
      the photos I can’t delete,<br>
      the way I scan every exit—even in peace.<br><br>
      It’s waking up three times a night<br>
      and lying to the mirror by morning.<br>
      It’s knowing the war didn’t stay<br>
      where I left it.<br><br>
      And it’s not killing me.<br>
      It’s just making everything heavier.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="poem">
      <h2>Blink</h2>
      <p>You’re folding laundry<br>
      and suddenly it’s Kandahar again.<br>
      Same hands,<br>
      but they’re shaking now.<br><br>
      A car backfires<br>
      and your ribs pull tight<br>
      like they remember<br>
      what your brain forgot to warn you about.<br><br>
      It’s not flashbacks.<br>
      It’s worse.<br>
      It’s memory ambush in the middle of<br>
      normal.<br><br>
      And no one sees you flinch.<br>
      Not even when you blink<br>
      and it’s all back.</p>
