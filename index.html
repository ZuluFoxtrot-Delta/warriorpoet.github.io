    <h2>The Paradox Of Peace And Violence</h2>
    <div class="poem">
      <strong>The Stillness of Peace</strong><br>
Peace is not mere absence; it is the presence of something profound.<br>
It is the tranquil lake reflecting the sky, undisturbed by ripples.<br>
It is the gentle breeze that whispers through ancient trees, carrying secrets of serenity.<br>
Peace is the refuge we seek when the world’s storms rage around us.<br><br>

But can one truly claim peace without acknowledging its counterpart?<br>
Is it enough to be harmless, like a lamb grazing in a meadow, unaware of the wolf’s shadow?<br>
Perhaps not.<br><br>

<strong>The Hidden Fire of Violence</strong><br>
Violence, too, has its facets.<br>
It is not solely the brute force that shatters bones or tears apart cities.<br>
Violence can be subtle, a word laced with venom, a glance that wounds deeper than any blade.<br>
It resides within us, dormant yet potent, waiting for the right spark.<br><br>

To be capable of violence is to recognize our humanity, the raw, unfiltered essence that pulses through our veins.<br>
It is the same force that fuels creation, for every birth carries the echo of cosmic explosions.<br>
Violence is the shadow cast by our potential, the yin to peace’s yang.<br><br>

<strong>The Dance of Duality</strong><br>
So, we find ourselves in this dance of duality.<br>
To be peaceful is not to deny our capacity for violence; it is to wield it consciously.<br>
Like a skilled swordsman who knows the blade’s weight and edge, we must understand our own darkness.<br><br>

True peace emerges when we integrate these seemingly opposing forces.<br>
It is the lotus blooming in the murky waters, a symbol of enlightenment rising from the mud.<br>
We become peaceful warriors, not denying our strength but channeling it toward compassion, justice, and healing.<br><br>

<strong>A Veteran’s Path</strong><br>
As a veteran, I have walked the razor’s edge, the battlefield where violence and peace collide.<br>
My service dog, Ruger, loyal and steadfast, provides tactile solace, grounding me in moments of turmoil.<br>
In my writings, I have woven threads of vulnerability and resilience, bridging the gap between heartache and hope.<br><br>

<strong>Concluding Thoughts</strong><br>
Remember, that peace is not passivity; it is the courage to transform violence into understanding.<br>
As Tyler Childers sings, “I swear I’ve seen the devil in my daddy’s eyes, but I’ve also seen an angel in the light.”<br>
Both exist within us, the devil and the angel, the violence, and the peace.<br><br>

I have learned, I must embrace my capacity for both.<br>
Be the calm before the storm and the storm itself.<br>
For in this delicate balance, I find the essence of being truly peaceful—a beacon of light in a world that often confuses harmlessness with harmony.<br>

    <h2>The Good Stuff</h2>
    <pre>
      “The Things I Never Unpacked”
I had been home nearly eleven years
before Kamryn took her first breath
and I still hadn&#x27;t unpacked.
Not my bags.
Not my war.
Not the silence I’d weaponized to stay functional.
I wasn’t dodging bullets anymore,
but I was dodging sleep,
dodging closeness,
dodging myself.
They said I was home.
But no one ever pointed to where that was.
I knew how to clear buildings.
I didn’t know how to sit still in a quiet room
without pacing it like a fire team stack.
I learned to fold laundry with the same precision I folded trauma.
Crisp edges. Tidy piles.
No mess in sight,
but nothing actually clean either.
I lived a lot of life before her.
Jobs. Mistakes. Lovers I kept at arm’s length
even when I held them close.
I played the part.
Laughed on cue.
Went through all the motions of normal.
But I was still deployed
just to a battlefield no one else could see.
And then she came.
Not like a rescue.
More like a reckoning.
Kamryn didn’t make me whole.
She made me honest.
For the first time in over a decade,
I had something in my arms
that didn’t flinch when I flinched.
That didn’t see the ghosts
and didn’t need to.
She just needed me.
So I started to unpack.
Slowly.
Deliberately.
One buried belief at a time.
That I had to be invulnerable.
That pain made me broken.
That love made me weak.
She taught me what armor couldn’t:
That real strength is the ability to stay
not just in the fight,
but in the room,
in the moment,
in her life.
I had a head start on healing.
But I was still lost until I heard her heartbeat
and realized mine hadn’t stopped—it had just gone underground.
“Her Backpack”
She doesn’t know it,
but I watch her every morning when she zips up her backpack.
It’s pink, overstuffed,
half-unzipped from yesterday’s rush.
There’s a crumpled drawing sticking out the side
a stick figure with a beard and tired eyes.
She told me it was me.
Smiling.
But what gets me isn’t the picture.
It’s the way she shoulders that pack
like it’s light,
like it’s nothing.
Because I know what we pass on to our kids
isn’t just DNA or bedtime stories.
It’s the invisible weight.
The stuff they carry
that they never knew had our name on it.
My daughter doesn’t know
she’s carrying the best version of me.
She doesn’t know
how many nights I sat in silence,
fighting not demons
but the fear that my love might not be enough
to cancel out the wars that shaped me.
I want her backpack to stay light.
I want her to grow up knowing
she doesn’t have to earn love through pain,
or bury her emotions to survive.
I want her to believe
stillness doesn’t mean danger
and that silence can be soft.
So I carry what I can,
and what I can’t,
I name.
So it doesn’t end up in her bag
by mistake.

    <h2>The Forever War</h2>
    <pre>
   The Forever War
In the shadowy trenches of a mind once bright,
Where memories fight a never ending plight,
I lay in silence, a weary soul&#x27;s lament,
A dance with darkness, a battle without bent.
The war is over, the battles are through,
Yet here I am, in a war zone anew.
My bed, a battleground, my sleep, a lie,
Where whispers of the night pierce through the sky.
Combat PTSD, a ghostly sentinel,
Guarding my thoughts, a tale to tell,
Of sights unseen, of sounds unheard,
Of moments frozen, in a heartless word.
Insomnia, the cloak that wraps me tight,
In a prison of the darkest night,
Her whispers taunt, her embrace a snare,
A silent scream, a desolate prayer.
And then the lucid night terrors come,
To haunt my slumber, a fiery sum.
Where dreams are bullets and fears take flight,
In the theater of the damned, where I fight.
The faces morph, the scenes intertwine,
With reality&#x27;s edge, forever fine,
I&#x27;m back in hell, the battle&#x27;s rage,
Where every breath is a silent wage.
My eyes wide open, yet I cannot move,
A marionette in a macabre groove,
The shadows play, the demons jest,
While my soul is put through a grueling test.
I am the soldier, I am the war,
The battleground is where I&#x27;ve been before.
But now the fight is not out there in the light,
It&#x27;s here in the dark, where fear takes flight.
Each dawn is a victory, a moment to hold,
A brief reprieve, a story untold,
But as nightfall descends, the battle is drawn,
I&#x27;ll fight till the end, till the break of dawn.
For I am not lost, though I may stray,
In the labyrinth of the mind&#x27;s decay,
I&#x27;ll find my peace, in the quietude,
Where the warrior&#x27;s heart is understood.
The nights are long, the days are hard,
But in the shadows, I&#x27;ll make my stand,
With every breath, every tear I shed,
I&#x27;ll conquer the fears that lie in bed.
For this is the fight that&#x27;s truly mine,
Where valor is not measured by time,
And though the scars may never fade,
I&#x27;ll rise from the ashes, unafraid.
The dawn will come, it always does,
And with it, a chance to live because,
In the throes of darkness, I&#x27;ve found my light,
A beacon of hope, a warrior&#x27;s might.
Life with PTSD, insomnia&#x27;s grip,
And lucid terrors that never quit,
Is a journey fraught with pain and fear,
But in the silence, I find my cheer.
I am the storm, the warrior&#x27;s son,
The one who fights, the battle never won,
But in the echoes of each scream,
I am the dawn, the sun&#x27;s esteemed.
So let the night come with all its might,
For I am ready to continue the fight,
Against the demons that plague my sleep,
I am the guardian, the watch I&#x27;ll keep

    <h2>The Clock Doesn’t Tick</h2>
    <pre>
 >The clock doesn’t tick in here,
not really.
It just glares, like a sentry that’s lost its soul. I’ve stopped counting hours.
Now I count breaths, and backsteps through corridors I swore I sealed shut.
Walls whisper like old teammates,
soft with gravel-throated warnings.
They speak in fireteam hand signals
etched on the insides of my eyelids.
Sometimes it’s just the wind.
Other times…it isn’t.
I tried the pills. Tried the whiskey.
Tried the rain sound app on my phone.
But silence, like death, has its own rank.
And tonight, it outranks me again.
Kamryn’s breath from the next room, steady. Anchoring.
The only thing that tells me I’m still on mission. Still needed. Still not a ghost.
But I patrol anyway.
From bed to door to window to memory
to hell and back again.
No boots. No weapon.
Just instinct and scars that refuse to sign the truce.
Sleep?
Sleep’s for men who came home
without unfinished wars stitched into their marrow. Sleep’s for the dead, and they’re not talking.
So, I write. Because at least this page
doesn’t flinch when I bleed on it.

    <h2>Tactical Leadership Writings</h2>
    <pre>
      “Command and Control”
I write my orders in the mirror each morning,
not barked, not printed,
just etched in the set of my jaw
and the stillness behind my eyes.
No one outranks me in this room,
and no one rescues me either.
I lead from the inside out.
First rule: Own everything.
The wins, the losses,
the shortcuts I didn’t take,
the silence I kept when noise was cheap.
Second rule: Scan the field.
Check the pulse,
of the team, the task, the tension in my spine.
There’s intel in emotion
and threats in routine.
I don’t wait for impact.
I adjust fire.
Decisions don’t need applause,
they need clarity.
And I’ve learned the difference
between reaction and response,
one is fear with a fuse,
the other is discipline in motion.
I delegate like I’m building leaders,
not followers.
I teach others to shoot straight,
not just bullets,
but truth.
My discipline is quiet.
Not a flex.
Not a post.
Just repetition
under pressure.
I’ve eaten the suck,
worn it like doctrine,
turned it into fuel
when the tank ran dry
and the team still needed light.
And at the end of each op,
whether it’s battle
or just a day full of small wars,
I sit with my own AAR:
What did I miss?
What did I carry that wasn’t mine?
What did I lead that mattered?
Because rank doesn’t make you a leader,
and resilience isn’t noise.
It’s grit in your boots
and peace in your chest,
when you’ve walked through fire
and still know
who you are.
“Not all ghosts whisper, some write”
  &quot;Orders from Within&quot;
I wake before the sun,
not because it’s noble,
but because silence is a weapon
and I sharpen it alone.
Discipline ain&#x27;t décor, it’s the scaffolding
I build my sanity on.
No one’s shouting orders here,
but the mission’s still live.
Move with intent.
Watch the terrain,
read the room like it’s booby-trapped
with old habits
and fragile egos.
I don’t just show up, I lead.
By example,
by the weight I carry quietly
when no one’s counting.
Because the real fight?
It ain’t out there, it’s in the choices
I repeat when no one’s watching.
I scan my day like a war map.
Where’s the friction?
Where can I maneuver?
Plans adapt,
people falter,
but I stay mobile,
mind sharp like a bayonet
on borrowed time.
Failure don’t rattle me,
I debrief it.
Turn setbacks into recon.
Every scar is intel,
every silence a signal.
And when the suck comes,
I don’t run.
I lace up, lean in,
and whisper back,
“I’ve trained for this.”
Because the mission never ends, 
it just changes names.
Father. Leader. Friend.
Still me.
Still fighting
to make every step
mean something.
And at night,
when I hang my armor,
I ask myself one thing:
“Did I live today
like someone worth following?”
“Not all ghosts whisper, some write”
“The Quiet Orders”
I don’t raise my voice to lead.
I don’t need to.
The standard’s already set
in the way I wake,
in how I lace my boots with purpose,
even when the world ain’t watching.
I’ve outgrown the need for loud.
Now I speak in routines,
in the muscle memory of showing up
when it’s hardest,
in the silence after failure
where most men fold,
but I plan the next move.
Call it obsession,
call it scars turned structure,
but I call it peace.
Because when the storm hits,
my calm isn’t performance,
it’s preparation.
Some write to impress.
I write like I’m bleeding truth
into pages that might outlast me.
Like each line is a breadcrumb
for someone lost in a future
I won’t live to see.
Not all ghosts whisper.
Some of us are still writing,
quiet orders from the past,
signed not for applause,
but for endurance.
For her.
For legacy.
For whatever war still echoes
after I’m gone.
“Written not to impress...written to endure.”
“Doctrine in the Dust”
I don’t write from comfort.
I write from the stillness after the blast,
the breath between
collapse and carry on.
My words aren’t ink…they’re ash and order.
The doctrine I built
after the manuals stopped working.
I never needed a perfect plan,
just the will to get up bleeding
and still move forward.
That’s the difference.
Some men wait for clarity.
I move through the fog
like it owes me something.
The quiet has rank.
It gives orders too.
So I keep the rhythm:
wake before weakness,
scan the field of my own thoughts,
lock down doubt like it’s a threat
wearing my father’s face
or my own reflection.
I’ve learned the war doesn’t end
when the shooting stops.
It just changes its name
and hides in the details.
In missed calls.
Unspoken truths.
The silence that grows teeth.
But I have my rules:
Show up.
Hold standard.
Speak only when it counts.
Leave something worth finding.
And when I go,
when the last entry’s written,
and my armor’s hung for good,
let her find these pages
and know I was never trying to be a hero.
I was trying to be whole.
And that’s harder.

    <h2>Message Of Impermanence</h2>
    <div class="poem">
     >Message of Impermanence:<br><br>
In the quiet stillness of meditation, we come to understand the profound truth of impermanence.<br> Every breath, every moment, every emotion—all are fleeting.<br> Just as the waves of the ocean rise and fall, so too do the circumstances of our lives.<br> Embracing impermanence allows us to release our grip on expectations and attachments, finding freedom in the ever-changing flow of existence.<br> It teaches us to savor the beauty of the present without clinging to the past or fearing the future, knowing that all things arise and pass away in their own time.
Message of Interconnectivity:<br>
Mindfulness reveals the intricate web of interconnectivity that binds us all. From the flutter of a butterfly&#x27;s wings to the beating of our own hearts,<br> we are part of a vast and interconnected universe. Our actions ripple outward, affecting others in ways seen and unseen.<br> Through mindfulness, we cultivate awareness of our interconnectedness, fostering compassion and empathy towards all beings.<br> We recognize that every person we encounter is on their own journey, navigating life&#x27;s challenges and seeking happiness and fulfillment.<br> By honoring our interconnected nature, we contribute to a more compassionate and harmonious world.<br>
Message of Patience:<br>
Patience is not merely waiting; it is a practice of mindful presence and acceptance.<br> In a world of instant gratification and constant stimulation, patience becomes a rare and precious gift.<br> It teaches us to slow down, to breathe, and to embrace each moment as it unfolds.<br> Through patience, we cultivate resilience in the face of adversity, understanding that growth and transformation take time.<br> It allows us to approach challenges with clarity and grace, knowing that difficulties are impermanent and opportunities for growth abound.<br> Patience nurtures inner peace and strengthens our capacity to respond to life&#x27;s ups and downs with equanimity and wisdom.<br>
Message of Compassion:<br>
Compassion is the heart&#x27;s response to suffering, both our own and that of others.<br> Mindfulness opens the door to compassion by deepening our awareness of the human experience—its joys, sorrows, and complexities.<br> It invites us to offer kindness and understanding without judgment, extending a gentle hand to those in need.<br> Through compassion, we create connections that transcend differences, fostering a sense of unity and belonging.<br> It teaches us to listen deeply, to hold space for vulnerability, and to act with generosity and kindness.<br> As we cultivate compassion within ourselves, we become beacons of light,<br> illuminating the path towards healing and harmony in our communities and beyond.<br>

    <h2>In The Silence Of The Night</h2>
    <pre>
     In the silence of the night, shadows creep, Memories of battles, secrets I keep.
Echoes of gunfire, the cries of the lost, Haunt my dreams, a relentless cost.
I walked through the valley where fear resides, Saw brothers fall, with tears in their eyes.
The weight of survival, a heavy chain,
Invisible scars, an endless pain.
In the chaos of war, I found my place,
But now in peace, I feel displaced.
The world moves on, but I remain,
Trapped in a loop of sorrow and pain.
Faces of brethren, forever etched,
In the canvas of my mind, deeply sketched.
Their voices whisper in the dead of night, A constant reminder of the fight.
I wear a mask, a soldier’s pride,
But inside, the turmoil I cannot hide.
Flashes of terror, moments of dread,
Live on in the battlefield inside my head.
I seek solace in the quiet, in the calm, But the storm within resists the balm.
Meditation, reflection, a fleeting peace, In the war within, there is no release.
Yet I hold on, to hope, to light,
In the darkest hours, I continue the fight.
For every dawn that breaks, a chance to heal, To find a way to live, to feel
